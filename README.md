# Sneaker-Predictions

Used GCP AI Platform to create a python notebook and run run a k-means clustering algorithm on sneaker data to provide the most similar sneakers based on price, description, brand, category, and color. These sneakers will serve to be effective investments based on the performance of a sneaker that is similar. 

Recommendation systems play a crucial factor in automating the sales opportunities for organizations. Being able to utilize these vast amounts of data allow for connections to be built between various objects to draw further conclusions such as what brand seems to be selling the best or is the most engaged with. The booming sneaker industry has recently made its way mainstream and has provided business opportunity for small businesses to profit on the secondary market. Not much research and development on recommendations has been done for the sneaker resale industry. The approach uses K-Means clustering techniques that focuses on identifying the resemblance between sneakers, and TF-IDF vectorizer for applying weights to the sneakers based on their commonly used descriptions words.
